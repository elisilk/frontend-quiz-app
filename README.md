## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming
- Fluid typography and spacing

### What I learned

- [How can I emulate prefers-color-scheme media query in Chrome?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57606960/how-can-i-emulate-prefers-color-scheme-media-query-in-chrome) - A cool trick for the Chrome DevTools to emulate a light or dark theme preference.
- Light and dark themes
- [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) vs. [`textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) vs.
- [Can I escape HTML special chars in JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6234773/can-i-escape-html-special-chars-in-javascript/6234804#6234804)
- [Remove All Elements with a Class Using JavaScript](https://stackabuse.com/bytes/remove-all-elements-with-a-class-using-javascript/)
- [Convert number to alphabet letter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36129721/convert-number-to-alphabet-letter)
- [Get loop counter/index using forâ€¦of syntax in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10179815/get-loop-counter-index-using-for-of-syntax-in-javascript)
- Looking for a CSS only styling of the input range (the progress bar).

### Continued development

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

Specific areas that the solution should be improved:

- Check the responsiveness of the header height
- Maintain the header height even without a category icon+text showing
- Style the progress bar
- Should the answer choice text be so big? And should it have some line spacing when it goes beyond one line?
- Remove the error message once an answer choice is selected (no need to wait for the submit answer button to be clicked)
- Remove the focus/active/hover state from a button after it is pressed - how to do this?
- Remove use of `innerHTML` in favor of [`insertAdjacentHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML) and related functions. Also remove use of `textContent`? Can affect how a question or answer is displayed. Examples:
  - CSS Q5
- Investigate why (and under what conditions) a correct answer is not marked as correct. Likely involves how the HTML is escaped either in the quiz data or in the HTML document. Seems to be mostly about the escape of single quote marks. Examples:
  - JavaScript Q1, Q7
  - Accessibilty Q2
- Reset the header after a quiz is completed
- Prevent users from selecting a different answer choice after the answer choice has been submitted

More general ideas I want to consider:

- Randomize the order of the answer choices for a particular question?
- Randomize the order of the questions?
